# X-Ray

X-Ray is my attempt to provide a toolset to create and view documentation for HDL (VHDL and Verilog) projects.
The existing tools geared for software do not capture the uniqueness of hardware design.
This project will provide a framework which can be applied to any HDL project.

# Goal
Document my design philosophy and create a tool to support it.

# Guiding principles

Clarity - Implementation should make it easy to learn about the design.
Modularity - Documentation must reside as close to the code as possible.

# Toolset

Python - Creating HTML pages from HDL source code
Javascript - Using web browser to display
