Block Documentation
===================

When considering what to document, I like to consider what I would like to know if given a new block of HDL code:

* Interfaces
* Register Map
** Registers
* Major functions of the block
* Block diagram showing connections between any sub-blocks
* Port Map
* What the block interfaces with
* Links to blocks this one connects with

This is my guide for what should be included in any HDL document.
Considering the phases of design, I would document them in the following order:

# jcl - need to define Design and Implementation phases

.Design

* Major functions of the block
* Interfaces
** Diagram showing what the block interfaces with
* What the block interfaces with
* Links to the blocks this one connects with

.Implementation

* Register Map
** Registers
* Block diagram showing connections between any sub-blocks
* Port Map

Prototype Considerations
------------------------

Philosophically, the Design documentation should be complete before any code is created.
Then the Implementation items could be autogenerated from the code.
The Prototype will have an example of the Design and Implementation items.
A top down flow of information will be created.
Later a horizontal presentation of the information will be created.
This all depends on how good I am at learning HTML and javascript.

* Should have a <div> for each element
** Functions
** Overview
** Interfaces

etc...
