Documentation Methodology
=========================

* Increasing detail from top to bottom
* Increasing detail from left to right
* Documentation should by located close to source files
* Documentation should be distributed

How do you collect and present all the information about a VHDL design in one place.
How do you make it easy for engineers and non-engineers to find the information they are looking for.

Define the information in an HDL design

Documentation Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|==================
| Element     | Purpose
| system      | The system the device(s) live in
| device      | The device(s) that make up the design
| component   | Sub parts of the devices
| register    | Accessible portions of the design via a processor
| memory map  | A collection of registers and the address to access them
| interface   | A defined collection of signals with a common purpose
| protocol    | How the collection of signals in an interface behave to produce a desired outcome
|==================

Define goals of organizing information
--------------------------------------

* Easy to find information
* Related information should be together
* Provide as much information on screen at one time
* Present based on level of detail
